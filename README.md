#### Balance Sheet (B/S) and Income Statements

We had to build queries and insert results into such queries to create the Profit and Loss (P&L) and Balance Sheet(B/S) statements.
Multiple SQL commands were used to build queries so that they fulfill the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles(GAAP). These financial statements consists of set of arithmetic formulae so we had to use the arithmetic commands to fulfill those conditions.

This project was made possible by a team of 4 postgraduate students and the team members contributed effortlessly to make this analysis.
